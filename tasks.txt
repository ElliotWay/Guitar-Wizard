---Might do soon.----------
- fix bug where actors still stand fighting no one - might be fixed?

- remove initialize static methods - almost done

- rewrite test runner class

- opponent wizard death - partially done

- auto-scrolling - maybe create a scroller class?

---Should do at some point.----------------
- fix miss/hit detection, possibly related to lag

- make hitting notes after switching blocks more robust

- restrict actors in same position?

- make music switches happen just before the switch point so it has time to switch - hmm

- create better opponent strategies

- archers are overpowered - partially solved?

- score counter?

- guarantee that assassins can't jump through shields

- replace actor lists with linked lists

- player wizard death

- handle finished song

- remove actors that fall off screen


---Bugs.-------------------	
- fix bug where timing is off for both position of notes and hitting them after quitting and starting again

- fix bug where late switches sometimes switch the music, but not the notes

- fix bug where player archers shoot too high?

- quitting to menu is broken

- tempo is off?


---Do Later.------------------
- smooth summoning meter animations

- create better shield sprite

- change arrow sprite to pixelated rotation - this may be difficult to tune

- pending switch indication

- proper lag handling


---Completed.---------------
