---Might do soon.----------
- better test coverage

- GameUITest - I missed this somehow.

- allow some animations to stop instead of looping


---Should do at some point.----------------
- fix miss/hit detection, possibly related to lag - ?

- score counter?

- indicate buffedness somehow - could be part of the responsiveness changes

- refactor even more of track switching into music area; give music area a referance back up to game ui

- quitting while dying causes immediate death on restart

- fix MainAreaTest, needless withArgs

---Bugs.-------------------	
- fix bug where timing is off for both position of notes and hitting them after quitting and starting again

- fix bug where late switches sometimes switch the music, but not the notes

- fix bug where player archers shoot too high?

- tempo is off?

- archers sometimes ignore assassins

- quitting to menu is broken - partially fixed, probably still broken, check regularly

- fix bug where actors still stand fighting no one
	- might be fixed?
	- broke during linked listing?


---Do Later.------------------
- change arrow sprite to pixelated rotation - this may be difficult to tune

- pending switch indication

- proper lag handling

- create better opponent strategies

- create better shield sprite

- responsiveness - visual reaction to every hit & miss?

- create more frames, they just look better that way

- create 3 more lightning animations


---Behavior that should be tested, is impossible or difficult to test, or is too simple to test--

- test-unbacked classes:
	AnimationCollection, ArcherSprite, AssassinSprite, ClericSprite,
	DefaultOpponent, DefaultSprite, EmptyAnimation, GWError, InfoArea, Lightning,
	Main, Menu, MenuTextButton, MiniSprite, OpponentStrategy

- untested stuff:
	arrows created by shooting<Archer>
	standing after shooting<Archer>
	wizard kill mode<MainArea>
	jumping through shields<Assassin>
	movement actually moves<Actor>
	starting and stopping, frequency<FrameAnimation>
	sets onComplete<FrameAnimation>
	projectile path<Projectile>
	projectile will finish if too low<Projectile>
	

---Completed.---------------
- lay out the rest of the screen - mostly done
- add synchronize function - wasn't necessary
- projectile animation has issues on the descent? - fixed: bug in checking for down left shots
- finish initial music assets - they still need editing
- smooth track transitions with switch points - started
- create initial actor types - finished
- create arrow sprite instead of triangle
- add info panel - will do this in parts instead of all at once
- fix bug where it's possible to hit notes that are not the first available - couldn't reproduce
- add unit creation meter - done
- refactor actor classes - almost all behavior now part of Actor instead of its subclasses
- create more actor assets - finished, mostly anyway
- fix issue with main area initializing twice - width and height parameters should be avoided
- create more general non-hardcoded start for MainArea
- remove enter frame listeners
- remove actors from acting list and minimap when dying
- stop archers from standing on left side trying to run
- change scale so the right amount of things fit on the screen - might have to change it again, sadly
- make units only attack in the correct direction - also significant changes to ActorTest
- create wizards - WIZARD!
- stop archers retreating behind shield
	- arrows can't go through the shield?
- rewrite actor sprite constructors
- create summoning animations
- create a way to color actor sprites to identify owner
- sync animations to beat
- make frame animation adjust scale instead of doing it manually
- negative effect of bad notes
- make clerics bless surrounding allies
- wizard towers
- archer punching animation, cleric blessing animation
- some indication of blessedness
- stop assassins from jumping through shields - bug with targeting using unrelative center
- wizard killing
- wizard end of summoning animation
- remove initialize static methods
- auto-scrolling - created a scroller class
- rewrite test runner class -sorta
- remove actors that fall off screen
- replace actor lists with linked lists
- archers are overpowered - underpowered now, I'll do some balancing later
- guarantee that assassins can't jump through shields
- smooth audio transitions by fading in/out
- edit test runner plugin - working, pending testing
- player assassins still jump past shield -  forgot scale parameter in flipping center
- player wizard death   )
- opponent wizard death > related - done, mostly
- handle finished song  )
- sigh...ugly though it'll be, replace the actor lists with vectors again - it's not so bad
- make hitting notes after switching blocks more robust
- cut holds that extend over blocks
- combos? lightning effect? - may still need to adjust range of lightning
- have wizard killing archers get closer
- smooth summoning meter animations
- refactor blocks so that blocks of hittable notes and blocks on the screen are associated with the same object
- create repeater class
