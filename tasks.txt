---Might do soon.----------
- sync animations to beat


---Should do at some point.----------------
- fix miss/hit detection, possibly related to lag

- make hitting notes after switching blocks more robust

- restrict actors in same position?

- make music switches happen just before the switch point so it has time to switch - hmm

- rewrite test runner class

- make clerics bless surrounding allies

- create better opponent strategies

- archers are overpowered - partially solved?


---Bugs.-------------------	
- fix bug where timing is off for both position of notes and hitting them after quitting and starting again

- fix bug where actors still stand fighting no one

- fix bug where late switches sometimes switch the music, but not the notes

- fix bug where player archers shoot too high?


---Do Later.------------------
- smooth summoning meter animations

- create better shield sprite

- change arrow sprite to pixelated rotation - this may be difficult to tune

---Completed.---------------

- lay out the rest of the screen - mostly done
- add synchronize function - wasn't necessary
- projectile animation has issues on the descent? - fixed: bug in checking for down left shots
- finish initial music assets - they still need editing
- smooth track transitions with switch points - started
- create initial actor types - finished
- create arrow sprite instead of triangle
- add info panel - will do this in parts instead of all at once
- fix bug where it's possible to hit notes that are not the first available - couldn't reproduce
- add unit creation meter - done
- refactor actor classes - almost all behavior now part of Actor instead of its subclasses
- create more actor assets - finished, mostly anyway
- fix issue with main area initializing twice - width and height parameters should be avoided
- create more general non-hardcoded start for MainArea
- remove enter frame listeners
- remove actors from acting list and minimap when dying
- stop archers from standing on left side trying to run
- change scale so the right amount of things fit on the screen - might have to change it again, sadly
- make units only attack in the correct direction - also significant changes to ActorTest
- create wizards - WIZARD!
- stop archers retreating behind shield
	- arrows can't go through the shield?
- rewrite actor sprite constructors
- create summoning animations
- create a way to color actor sprites to identify owner
