---Might do soon.----------
- fix bug where actors still stand fighting no one - might be fixed?

- quitting to menu is broken - can't reproduce, but it'll come back up

- sigh...ugly though it'll be, replace the actor lists with vectors again

- edit test runner plugin - import strings of class names


---Should do at some point.----------------
- fix miss/hit detection, possibly related to lag - ?

- make hitting notes after switching blocks more robust

- make music switches happen just before the switch point so it has time to switch - hmm

- score counter?

- player wizard death   )
- opponent wizard death > related
- handle finished song  )

- combos? lightning effect?

- create better shield sprite


---Bugs.-------------------	
- fix bug where timing is off for both position of notes and hitting them after quitting and starting again

- fix bug where late switches sometimes switch the music, but not the notes

- fix bug where player archers shoot too high?

- tempo is off?


---Do Later.------------------
- smooth summoning meter animations

- change arrow sprite to pixelated rotation - this may be difficult to tune

- pending switch indication

- proper lag handling

- create better opponent strategies
