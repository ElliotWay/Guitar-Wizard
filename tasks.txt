- fix miss/hit detection, possibly related to lag

- create a way to color actor sprites to identify owner

- fix bug where player archers shoot too high?

- make hitting notes after switching blocks more robust

- create more general non-hardcoded start for MainArea

- change arrow sprite to pixelated rotation - this may be difficult to tune

- stop archers from standing on left side trying to run

- smooth summoning meter animations

- remove actors from acting list and minimap when dying

- restrict actors in same position?

- make music switches happen just before the switch point so it has time to switch

- remove enter frame listeners
