---Might do soon.----------
- fix bug where actors still stand fighting no one - might be fixed? - broke during linked listing?

- combos? lightning effect?


---Should do at some point.----------------
- fix miss/hit detection, possibly related to lag - ?

- score counter?

- indicate buffedness somehow

- have wizard killing archers get closer

- refactor blocks so that blocks of hittable notes and blocks on the screen are associated with the same object


---Bugs.-------------------	
- fix bug where timing is off for both position of notes and hitting them after quitting and starting again

- fix bug where late switches sometimes switch the music, but not the notes

- fix bug where player archers shoot too high?

- tempo is off?

- archers sometimes ignore assassins

- quitting to menu is broken - partially fixed, probably still broken, check regularly


---Do Later.------------------
- smooth summoning meter animations

- change arrow sprite to pixelated rotation - this may be difficult to tune

- pending switch indication

- proper lag handling

- create better opponent strategies

- create better shield sprite

- responsiveness - visual reaction to every hit & miss?


---Completed.---------------
