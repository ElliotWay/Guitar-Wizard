# Guitar-Wizard

A game that I worked on between undergrad and graduate school to keep my programming skills sharp.

Writing it in Actionscript was certainly a mistake; Flash was dying when I started and has died for good since.
I remember spending a lot of time trying to optimize because Flash was slow.
I should have written it in Unity.

But I'm keeping it up because it's my most recent code sample that wasn't related to research.

In particular, I tried to write tests for everything; this was not that long after taking a Software Engineering course, so I wanted to try test driven development.
I even wrote a plugin in C# to add a button to run all tests to the free Actionscript editor I was using; I've since lost the source for that.

The game was a rhythm/strategy game - you hit notes along with music, and the gimmick was that you could change the music style to summon different types of units on a strategy layer. The rhythm part of the game worked cleanly, but the strategy layer wasn't that much fun.

I also wrote a song editor to allow for linking key presses to the music. It was written in Java with a Swing GUI because that was the only GUI I was familiar with after undergrad. I've since lost the source, but I was proud of the editor; it has a robust undo system and allows for copying and pasting key presses for repeated sections. It can load a MIDI file then sync the timing of key presses to the time of MIDI events.

Ultimately this project was doomed from the start, but I still enjoyed writing it and making all my pixel art assets.
