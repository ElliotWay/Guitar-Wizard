A rhythm/strategy flash game, or at least a prototype thereof.

I'll probably switch to a private repo at some point, but right now I can't justify the expense for something I don't even know is going to be any good.

Hitting notes summons units on a one dimensional strategy layer, the player can switch between 3 different styles of the same song to summon different units.

Any potential employers can email me for the assets to get this to work, or just a zip file with an executable.
